## 👋 Who Am I?

I’m **Salem Alnaqbi**, a **Drilling Engineer turned Applied AI Practitioner** working at the intersection of **subsurface engineering, drilling operations, energy systems, and sustainability**.

### 🧠 What does *Applied AI Practitioner* mean?
It means I focus on **using AI to solve real operational problems**, not just training models for academic results.

I work with:
- Real, **messy industrial data**
- Operational constraints and safety-critical decisions
- ML pipelines that support **planning, execution, and performance improvement**

My goal is to **bridge domain expertise with machine learning** to deliver AI that is *deployable, interpretable, and trusted by engineers*.

## 🚀 What I’m Actively Building

### 🔹 Subsurface & Drilling Intelligence *(Core Focus)*
- Machine learning applied to **well logs, drilling parameters, and subsurface datasets**
- **Rock / facies classification** using shape, texture, and log responses
- **Sweet-spot identification** through multi-log correlation (porosity, permeability, saturation, density, etc.)
- Drilling performance analytics to support **well planning and execution decisions**
- Translating geological + drilling expertise into **AI-assisted workflows** for real operations

### 🔹 Drilling Planning & Operational Analytics
- Historical drilling analysis to improve **ROP, NPT, and overall well performance**
- Pattern recognition in drilling parameters to flag **operational risk and inefficiencies**
- Supporting **planning, benchmarking, and post-well reviews** using ML insights

### 🔹 Computer Vision for Industrial Safety *(Growing Focus)*
- Vision-based monitoring for rig and site operations
- Anomaly detection and condition assessment for industrial equipment
- Applying deep learning where **human safety and operational integrity** matter

### 🔹 Water & Sustainability Analytics
- Predictive models for **water quality indicators** (e.g., pH)
- Classical ML + probabilistic approaches for environmental monitoring
- Supporting sustainability through **data-informed decisions**

### 🔹 Energy Systems & Forecasting *(Secondary)*
- Time-series forecasting to support **operational visibility and planning**
- Scenario analysis under supply and demand uncertainty
- Using AI as **decision support**, not black-box prediction

### 🔹 Industrial AI Systems & Automation
- Python-based data pipelines for **engineering and operational workflows**
- Automating reporting and analytics to reduce manual effort
- Designing systems that make AI **usable by engineers**, not just data scientists
